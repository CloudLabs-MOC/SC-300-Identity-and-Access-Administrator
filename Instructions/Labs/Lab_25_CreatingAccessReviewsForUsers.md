# Lab 25 - Creating Access Reviews for Internal and External Users  

## Lab scenario

Privileged user access should be regularly reviewed in a similar manner.  Since these are elevated access assignments, the review of these should be done on a consistent basis as identified by the company.  Unused and unnecessary privileged assignments should be removed.  Automated removal should also be configured for users that are no longer with the company or have changed departments within the company.
