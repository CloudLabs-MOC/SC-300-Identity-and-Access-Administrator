# Lab 15 - Configure an Multifactor authentication registration policy'

## Lab scenario

Multifactor authentication provides a means to verify who you are using more than just a username and password. It provides a second layer of security to user sign-ins. For users to be able to respond to MFA prompts, they must first register for Microsoft Entra Multifactor Authentication. You must configure your Microsoft Entra organization's MFA registration policy to be assigned to all users.

## Lab Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Task 1 - Complete Policy configuration
- Task 2 - Configure Azure AD Identity Protection policy for MFA registration
