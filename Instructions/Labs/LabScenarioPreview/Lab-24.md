# Lab Scenario Preview: SC-300:  Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator

## Lab 24: Manage the lifecycle of external users in Azure AD Identity Governance settings

### Lab overview
You can select what happens when an external user, who was invited to your directory through an access package request being approved, no longer has any access package assignments. This can happen if the user relinquishes all their access package assignments, or their last access package assignment expires. By default, when an external user no longer has any access package assignments, they are blocked from signing in to your directory. After 30 days, their guest user account is removed from your directory.
