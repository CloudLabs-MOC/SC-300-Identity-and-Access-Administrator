You can also complete optional fields, such as Department and Usage location, at this time. The following screenshot is an example of how you can complete the .csvfile: 

    ![Bulk import using csv file entry](./media/bulk121.png)

      >**Note:** You do not need to fill out all the fields. As per the sample data provided, you mainly need to add the username information. Be careful not to leave any extra white spaces in the Excel sheet else Bulk creation will fail.
       
      >**Note:** You can copy the domain name for all the users in the Azure portal from the Overview page, copy the primary domain name, and replace **<<<enter your domain name>>>** with primary domain name for all the users.

3. Once you are done with replacing the domain names, save the file as **BulkUser** in the **Downloads** section and close the file.

4. In the Microsoft Entra ID menu, select **Users** under **Manage**.

7. You will be notified that the file has been uploaded successfully. Choose **Submit** to add the users. 

8. After the users have been created, you will be prompted that the creation has succeeded.  Close the Bulk create users tile and the new users will be populated in the list of **Users | All users**.

#### Task 2 - Addition of users using PowerShell

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator. This can be done by searching for PowerShell in Windows and choosing Run as administrator. 

   >**Note** - Select **PowerShell** and not **PowerShell ISE**.

    ```
    Install-Module AzureAD
    Import-Module AzureAD
    ```

3. Confirm that the module is installed correctly by running the command:  

    ```
    Get-Module AzureAD 
    ```

4. Next, you will need to login to Azure by running:  

    ```
    Connect-AzureAD 
    ``` 

5. The Microsoft login window will appear for you to log in to Azure AD.  

   >**Note:** If you get any warnings you can click on **Yes**

6. To verify that you are connected and to see existing users, run:  

    ``` 
    Get-AzureADUser 
    ```
    
7. To assign a common temporary password to all new users, run the following command and replace the TempPW with the password that you would like to provide to your users.  

    ``` 
    $PasswordProfile = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile
    ```

    ```
    $PasswordProfile.Password = "<<enter a secure password you will remember>>" 
    ```

8. You are ready to create a new users.  The following command will be populated with the user information and run.  If you have more than one user to add, you can use a notepad txt file to add the user information and copy/paste into PowerShell. 

    ```
    New-AzureADUser -DisplayName "New User" -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile -UserPrincipalName "NewUser@labtenantname.com" -AccountEnabled $true -MailNickName "Newuser"
    ```

    >**Note** - Replace **labtenantname.com** with the **azurehol...onmicrosoft.com** name assigned by the lab tenant.You can find it in the Primary domain section of Microsoft Entra ID Overview page

## Experiment with managing users

You can add and remove users with the Microsoft Entra ID page.  However, users can be created and roles can be assigned using the scripting.  Experiment with giving the Chris Green user account a different role using script.

It may happen that an account is deleted and then needs to be recovered. You need to verify you can recover an account that has been deleted recently.

#### Task 1 - Remove a User
